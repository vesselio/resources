                <h3> Step 1 - Variation Control Distribution</h3>
                Variation is a formal technique where test is given in an altered form for incoming user. Ideally equal distribution produces better results.

                You can change the distribution of variation for a given test. By default, it is set to 50-50% We recommend that you use this distribution to ensure that results are statistically significant. </li>

                <h3> Step 2 - Define Variation Controls (Optional) </h3>
                <P>You can also add in Variation Control. Variation controls allow you associate data to each variation which will be made available to the devices.</p>
