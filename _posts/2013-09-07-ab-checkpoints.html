        <h3>How to report a checkpoint?</h3>
        <p>
            Example below will show you how to track checkpoints in Landing Screen test. (You can track checkpoints as per your needs.)

       <h3>Checkpoint Api</h3>

        <p>To report a checkpoint, you can use the VesselAB.checkPointVisited() method as show below</p>
{% highlight java %}
// e.g. If user signUp with facebook then you can report checkpoint as follows

// This method will report checkpoint to all active tests.
VesselSDK.reportCheckpoint("CHECKPOINT_NAME"); // e.g. Cliked on Facebook or Bought Coins

Or

// This method will report checkpoint to only onboarding A/B test. 
VesselAB.reportCheckpoint("YOUR_TEST_NAME", "CHECKPOINT_NAME");

Or 

You can also send additional metadata along with checkpoints. E.g. We would like to send user information along with checkpoint.

try {
    JSONObject metaData = new JSONObject();
    metaData.put("paidUser", true);
    metaData.put("adCampaign", "bannerAds");
    metaData.put("boughtCoins", false);

    VesselAB.reportCheckpoint("YOUR_TEST_NAME", metaData);

} catch (JSONException e) {
